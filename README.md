Ruksi's Leap Demo - Shadow Puppets
==================================

This demo is a Ruby on Rails + Backbone app.

It lets visitors record and play shadow hand puppet gestures.
Leap Motion is required to view the shadow puppets.

When uploading gesture data on creation and edit, wait a good while, it takes around 10 seconds depending
on your connection and where the app is hosted.

Check [LOGBOOK.md](/LOGBOOK.md) for more details about the development.

TODO:
----

* Add cropping to gesture editing.

* Add loading animation to uploads.
