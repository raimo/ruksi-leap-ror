Logbook
=======

This is a brief logbook where I record how I'm approaching the challenge
outside a pure coding perspective i.e. setup of environment, thoughts
and whatnot. Not mandatory for the challenge, but I think you might find
this interesting.

Saturday, 10:55
- Arrived at the office.
- Started working on my Windows machine at the office as my Leap Motion and
  Oculus Rift are there.
- Searched "Leap Motion" in Thunderbird to find Leap Motion Web Engineering
  Challenge email that was sent to me on 19.2.
- Read the challenge through to get an idea what is expected of me:
  GitHub, Heroku, Rails, PostgreSQL, Leap Motion JavaScript library, Bootstrap,
  possibly Backbone/React, keep-it-simple-stupid, bug-free.
- Though what might be the target of this challenge, obviously to test me
  so I had this idea of writing a logbook to get a glimpse how I work.
  Created `LOGBOOK.md` to desktop.
- Checked if I had Ruby installed, got 2.1.5 installed, leftovers from
  Rails Girls coaching a few weeks ago. I've been involved only in a few
  RoR projects before so wasn't sure.
- Checked if I had Rails installed, got 4.2.0, that's the newest, OK, nice.
- `rails new ruksi-leap-ror`
- `git init; git add -A; git commit -m "new rails project";`
- Went to GitHub, make a private repository (shyguy, huh?), copy paste
  the two lines to setup and update the remote repo as I'm lazy.
- Downloaded and installed RubyMine, helps to grasp the correct syntax
  and catch all the newbie mistakes. I personally love IDEs by JetBrains,
  I've got license for the most of them.

Saturday, 11:14
- Opened the new rails project with RubyMine.
- As it generates `.idea` folder, added a few lines to `.gitignore`
  that shouldn't be shared between IDE installations. Copy-pasta from
  previous projects on my machine.
- Now usage of git becomes GUI based, can more easily see the
  changes that are to be committed.
- Added this `LOGBOOK.md` to git.
- Went to make coffee.
